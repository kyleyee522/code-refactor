# Code Refactor

## Description

- This challenge was for me to become familiar with semantic HTML elements

- By using semantic HTML elements, it helps search engine optimization and screen readers. Additionally, it improves readability which is helpful for when other programmers read my code.

- In this challenge, I learned the various semantic HTML elements. While they don't cause a special/unique appearance, it makes it understand what content is inside these elements. Likewise, I learned the differences between the "main", "section", and "aside" tags/elements and the various uses for them.
